Hey, I’m sreeram. I’ve been wanting to start a blog for years. I’ve made attempts before, but I struggled to find enough content. Then, much later, when I landed on my job and had a few months before starting, I felt this strong urge to finally create & publish some content. Well, I am too shy for youtube and instagram anyway. So, I started the journey to create a website where I could share content that I believe worth sharing.

Then I started searching in youtube about content writing and encountered the book review “Show Your Work”. The book tells us to involve in the creative process rather than just the final product. That idea resonated deeply with me — document,don’t create.

Another main influence was the 512kb club. This showcases websites that are brilliantly crafted within 512kb. These minimalistic websites truly inspired me to create and share my own explorations. I experimented with platforms like Wix, Blogspot, and WordPress. Then I found Hugo- a static site generator without modern bloated JS. As I surfed the web, I stumbled upon some seriously awesome blogs. And I thought, “Why not give it a try?” So here I am, diving into this blogging adventure!

The primary aim of this platform is to document the blog-worthy things I have done. It’s all about keeping it authentic; not worrying about what my relatives or that friend from forever ago might think. If I step into the shoes of a reader and think, ‘Wow, this is cool!’, that’s exactly the kind of stuff you’ll find on this blog. Moreover, I would love to [connect](mailto:sreeraminsights@gmail.com) with remarkable individuals like you. So, welcome aboard and Join me in this exploration!
