I'll share my dot files in this post.
{{< blockquote >}}
Dotfiles are configuration files for various applications and system settings in Unix-based operating systems, typically named with a leading dot (e.g., .bashrc, .gitconfig, .vimrc). These files are used to customize and control the behavior of your operating system and software, and they often reside in your home directory.
