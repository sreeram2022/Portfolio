# Abstract
• In this project I have used openCV library and Mediapipe framework in python to detect both
hand and head gestures.

• When our system’s camera detects gesture, it’ll process the image and verifies with
predetermined positions for left, right, back and acceleration. Accordingly the system will display
the output.
