Iâ€™ve installed ubuntu server on my old lenovo laptop.

The ip address is 192.168.0.118

If we want to access via sftp in terminal the commands:

sftp://rama@192.168.0.118

Password: Chanakya#01

- We can even access through finder or any file manager. (ease of access)

But with terminal

put:- for uploading files to server

To upload a complete folder, first create a folder with the same name then

put -r foldername

get:- downloading files from server

exit to exit from server.

we can access our plex media server through http://192.168.0.118:32400/web.
